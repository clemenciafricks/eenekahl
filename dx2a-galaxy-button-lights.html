I recently upgraded (Verizon) my fiancee's phone from an S7 edge to the S8+ -- we both have owned the S7 edges since launch and they have been excellent phones. She decided to upgrade, I wanted to wait a bit before pulling the trigger. Once we got her S8+ setup, I marveled at her battery life and seemingly overall 'snappiness' of her phone. She would send me texts throughout the day providing (jabbing) me updates on her battery. Mid-mornings, she'd be at 95% and my S7 edge would.

I say "root-like things" for lack of a better phrase.For example, I just found this app called Galaxy Button Lights (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights&hl=en) that lets you decide how long, if at all, the back and menu keys stay lit. Since the Note 5 can't be rooted, I was wondering if there were any other apps that have functionality similar to this that let you control system processes and so on.

Hey, Reddit! Is there any way I can make the Galaxy Button Lights fade in and out instead of just turning on and off? Thanks. 
I use the app 'Galaxy Button Lights' and it allows me to keep the capacitive buttons on (lit up) for a certain amount of time, and I have mine set to 10 seconds, and with the majority of my time using my phone scrolling and using the screen, the buttons are practically lit up all the time.

I'm thinking about switching to an XS, coming from a Pixel 2. I've had iPhones and Android phones before. What really has blown me away on the Pixel 2 is how good it is taking photos of moving targets. I take a lot of pictures of our two dogs, and despite them jumping around like crazy I can get clear, detailed and in focus shots of them consistently. Makes me look like a great photographer when I'm really the opposite. I tried a Galaxy S9 briefly. I'm sure the camera is great, and reviews. Today my battery was running low, even after using Power Saving Mode, so I turned on UPSM at about 4% (not the first time I use it). When I got home, I started charging the phone and turned UPSM off, then began to use it normally. To my surprise, I noticed that both soft buttons were giving no feedback (no vibration, no back lights), so I immediately figured something went wrong with UPSM. Keyboard feedback works, and both soft keys work; so far I've tried: Turning UPSM on and off. Manuall. I know that it's possible to turn off the softkeys using the Galaxy Buttons Light app, but is there a way to just dim the softkeys instead of turning them entirely off? It's nice to at least see something at night instead of guessing where the buttons. 
They started doing this with the S6 and S6 Edge and I was annoyed to see it continue with my Note 5 I received yesterday. It's a feature that is in every other version of Samsung devices and I have no idea why TMo continues to insist on removing it from their models. It can easily be remedied by download the app "Galaxy Button Lights" from the Play Store, but you really shouldn't I'm trying to see if there is a way for Tasker to automatically turn off the soft key buttons using Galaxy Button Lights (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights). I came across a previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1q6mfw/galaxy_s3_soft_key_buttons/) for the S3, but there really wasn't an answer. I'm new to Tasker (can't root unfortunately) so I can't for the life of me figure out a workaround -- other than having the app launc. sometimes the buttons do work as normal and dragging things on the screen works as normal (but not very often). I've tried clearing the cache and then I did I factory reset but yet the problem persists. sometimes the phone gets very hot (but that also happened sometimes before having these issues). Hi guys, I was using my Galaxy S6 and I accidentally dropped it. I tried to turn it on but it won't turn on. The LED light stays blue and will not do anything. I tried to call but it sounds like is off (the buttons are not illuminated). I connected it to the computer (and sometimes it will turn on the red light, sometimes it won't respond at all and I have used different USB cables). I tried to run the recovery mode, it didn't work.
